                <p>Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.
                </p>
                <p>Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled.
                    Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs, preventing the full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully there are ways to make the most of every donation to charity.
